# DynamicEcosystemLabeling_CO2_analysis

This repository contains the R scripts used for headspace CO2 analysis based on the DEL (Dynamic Ecosystem Labeling) system's datalogger output files. The DEL system conducts 13CO2 labeling of plants in the field or greenhouse settings (publication to follow), delivering 13CO2 into the labeling chambers so the 13C can be assimilated by plants and transfered belowground in order to track soil microbial food web.
